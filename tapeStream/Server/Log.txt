Making sure Loading since time is EST
Making sure red quote time behind is all EST so works...
Show thw contents of the TDAAuth.json file by pulling values in init of TDA Auth page
Changed "TDA Auth" to "Authorizations", more elegant and consistent, and will add RH Auth stuff later
Contracts increments from 1 to 10 and from 10 to 1 instead of 1 to 11 and 10 to 0
Correct Breakeven is between the strikes
Can move business calcs like BE to TDABus class?
Save the long strike of the spread as part of the TDAOptionQuote object
Save the checkstate of the spread row

Switch to Radzen Grid so can do paging or scrolling
Move code to calc prems etc to ?function OR ? Data Service and get with i
get from List for Grid

Added Skips so 
----------
Adding Depth which is number of spreads to allocate Contracts over, starting from a checked Strike
The checked strike is least risky strike and get's most contracts, strikes closer to ITM get progessively fewer contracts
------------------------
Iron Condor should be a range so if higher on call side, should be hogher on put side as well, could use ATR 

the Skips sb per tab, may want diff Skip on put and call
need 

So you will be able to trade Depth if Buy and Sell "To Open" is a parameter and multiple places are allowed.
Or you don't overlap

So I have Sold 304 Bot 303
Cant Sell 303 Buy 302
			   302 Bot 301 

			   You gibe it Cash itives you shares? g


ITM longStrikes are wrong

Adding spreads causes overlaps

Add > button to left of each row to show detail, by inserting a templated row, like
.Greeks and 
.chart of optionprices or any other stat
.order details if in an order? full order or just thia strinke?

AmMZN collateral looks crazy high

The Ask on OptionTable is not being updated, so get grazy premiums since it's the Buy

v Add one more strike to each side then hide using last-child?

Premiums not reflecting the spread

There is no overlap if Spread > 1 !

Overap is more complicated - just can't sell in one trade and buy in another

Collateral is not using the spread?

Create a sep app to do streaming with a UI that shows streams coming in & use it to capture option candles to database (or files?)
DB best so can replay days to see what max profit could have been.

Can use MS Charts with Blazor?

Use the sparkline to show profit profile for individual vertical with one for whole vertical at the top
Click on vertical spark to get popup of detailed profile

Make indi check boxes apply to row and top to clear all, un check removes, disable enabling conflicts? or ntify of conflicts before buy or on selection

Dashboard for home screen that summarizes all positions and active balances across all accounts all connections health, data throughput, etc
Consider WEBASSEMBLYMAN or roll your own WASM has not dynamic but when adapts to environment, i.e. 


Save and restore user parameter setting to file so can restore next time opens?

Need to use description or instead of index so don't get same pick on call and put side

Need to have sep parms for call & put so can do iron condors which will show on 
or show local total on bottom and IC on top 

Losing contracts
First ITM options not using right long price

So the Log 


So, reason so many outside trades is quotes not being updated if T&S being received. 
ANswer is to use sep sockets. Can that be done? Nope! So just poll for quotes or use another account (means tons of setup and 2 auth setups)
RECEIVED: {"notify":[{"service":"Invalid Service","timestamp":1589987086433,"content":{"code":12,"msg":
"This Streamer was disconnected because of another connection for this username and password. 
Each user may only have one Streamer open at a time."}}]}

So can a sep thread just keep quote updated in background?
Or after each t&s receipt, update quote for next receipt

Answer was order of requests, t&s had been first which swamped quotes. Made quotes first and all is working!

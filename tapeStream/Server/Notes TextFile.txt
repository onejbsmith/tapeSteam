Client chart components and the data that they display

BookColumnsChart			


Plan is to generate that data on the server (possibly in BackgroundService Workers)
and send it to the client using SignalR


Problem is data needs to be processed which takes time which slows tda

So, writing all to files to be used for a message Q

Need to write services to pull from Q and create data for charts and push t SignalR

One for T&S 
One for NASDAQ_BOOK

They push but also write to files

They need to be turned into services so always running, same for the tdaStreamer

Once done, the client should be happy and run smoothly

Nice to see how far behind we get...

Hopefully approaches real-time
